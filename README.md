# Java synchronization
A synchronized method provides a strategy for preventing the thread interference and memory consistency errors. 
If an object is accessible by more than one thread, all reads or writes operation to that object's fields 
should be done by a synchronized method. This projects describes types of synchronization and particularly 
usage of a `synchronized` keyword and provides few examples how synchronization works on simultaneous invocation of 
different type of a synchronized method. For example, is it possible to call simultaneously a synchronized method of 
an instance of a class and synchronized static method of the class?
